/*
 (Comparing Values) Write a program that asks the user
to enter the highest rainfall ever in oever in one season
for a country, and the rainfall in the current year for
that country, obtains the values from the user, checks if
the current rainfall exceed the highest rainfall and prints
an appropriate message on the screen. If the current 
rainfall is higher, it assigns that value as the highest 
rainfall ever. Use only the single-selection form of the 'if' 
statement you learned in this chapter.
